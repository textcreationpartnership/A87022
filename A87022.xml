            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The reason why some things are not set down clear in Scripture.</note> or <hi>Obscurities</hi> of <hi>Intimations,</hi> is clear, and may here fitly be mentioned. before we proceed any farther. Because in those <hi>times</hi> wherein (and among those, for whose <hi>present</hi> use) the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of the <hi>New Testament</hi> were written, these things were already so exactly known in their <hi>Originals,</hi> and in all other <hi>circumstances</hi> of them, that any larger <hi>description</hi> of them was perfectly <hi>superfluous,</hi> some things being <hi>instituted</hi> in their times, other by known <hi>Records</hi> delivered, and by daily <hi>discourse</hi> or <hi>practise</hi> made <hi>fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar</hi> to them. Thus in <hi>Christs first Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> to his <hi>Disciples,</hi> there was no <hi>necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> that he should <hi>command</hi> them the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of those three great parts of <hi>Religion, Alms giving, Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> being all of them by <hi>Jewish Laws</hi> and <hi>Usages</hi> sufficiently known among them. And therefore when <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. he gives rules for the <hi>regulating</hi> the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of these, he doth rather <hi>suppose</hi> them already practised among his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, then give any <hi>Commands</hi> for the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:169777:12"/> of them, <hi>When thou dost alms,</hi> v. 3. <hi>When ye pray,</hi> v. 7. and, <hi>When ye fast,</hi> v. 16. And then if this <hi>acknowledgedness</hi> of such particulars, was the reason of making no <hi>larger,</hi> or <hi>clearer</hi> mention of them, how <hi>unreasonable</hi> would it be from that <hi>Negative</hi> argument of their not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>expresly</hi> mentioned in <hi>Scripture,</hi> to prove that they were not <hi>Instituted,</hi> or to make <hi>doubt</hi> or <hi>question</hi> of the <hi>institution</hi> of them. And whereas it may probably be replied, that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> were <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for our instruction,</hi> and not onely for them in whose <hi>age</hi> they were <hi>written,</hi> the <hi>answer</hi> will be most satisfactory, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be with all thankfulness to <hi>God</hi> acknowledged to be so, in respect of those things which are largely <hi>set down</hi> in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and even of those, in some degree, which are not, but onely <hi>intimated</hi> and referred to there, yet that <hi>mercy</hi> of <hi>Gods</hi> is not <hi>lessened</hi> to us, but <hi>improved</hi> by the <hi>addition</hi> of this other, that for those <hi>things,</hi> which are not at <hi>large</hi> set down there (and so may usefully be explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to those, that at this <hi>distance</hi> are not able to read that <hi>darker character</hi>) the same <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>graciously</hi> provided a competent <hi>supply</hi> by those <hi>Records</hi> of <hi>Primitive</hi> and <hi>pure Antiquity,</hi> that are by the <hi>good hand</hi> of <hi>Providence</hi> happily <hi>preserved</hi> to us.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>75</label> Now to all this endevour the <hi>answer</hi> will be brief and evident, by observing but two things, which quite take away all <hi>force</hi> of these <hi>testimonies.</hi> First, that
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:169777:77"/> the people of the <hi>Iews,</hi> as since the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> are figuratively and <hi>mystically</hi> said in <hi>Scripture</hi> to be <hi>espoused</hi> by <hi>God, marryed</hi> to himself, and consequently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very degree of <hi>Idolatry</hi> or <hi>Apostasie</hi> from him is, by the same <hi>figure,</hi> expressed by <hi>fornicating,</hi> or going a <hi>whoring,</hi> i. e. <hi>break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> that <hi>Covenant</hi> which they had made with <hi>God,</hi> resembled by <hi>God</hi> to a <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-Covenant.</hi> And there is nothing more ordinary then such <hi>figures</hi> as this in all manner of <hi>sacred</hi> and <hi>profane</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, which yet no way prejudge or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the use of the same word in the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> sense without any <hi>figure</hi> in it, but contrariwise suppose this acception of it for the <hi>violation</hi> of the <hi>marriage-bed,</hi> or else there could be no place for such <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From hence therefore that which will <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>76</label> be deducible is this, that where there is no place for the <hi>literall interpretation,</hi> there such <hi>figurative</hi> notions are to be admitted: as when <hi>Philo</hi> mentions the <hi>fornicating soul,</hi> or the <hi>Scripture, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after other Gods,</hi> there it must be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the <hi>figurative</hi> sense, because <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal fornication</hi> is not incident to <hi>souls,</hi> or fastened to <hi>Gods</hi> or <hi>Idols.</hi> But when there is place for the <hi>proper</hi> or first sense, then what reason can there be to prefer, or <hi>substitute</hi> the <hi>figurative?</hi> And so it is visibly in <hi>Christs</hi> words, where the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:169777:78"/>
                     <hi>man puts away the wife for fornication.</hi> By this means <hi>five</hi> of the former <hi>testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> are evidenced to be of no force, to infer the desired conclusion; that of <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. <hi>Lev.</hi> 20. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. <hi>Num.</hi> 14. of <hi>Philo,</hi> and perhaps a <hi>sixth,</hi> that out of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> if it be taken to signifie any eminent <hi>Idolater</hi> or <hi>Apostate.</hi>

And it being by him expresly affirmed, that that notion <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains adultery</hi> under it, it seems to me most reasonable to <hi>interpret S.

Of which as <hi>adultery</hi> is one, so it is but one. And so <hi>fornication,</hi> that comprehends all <hi>unlawful lusts,</hi> will still be that onely head of sins, for which <hi>divorces</hi> are ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable to be allowed by <hi>Christ.</hi> And whether for all the sorts of that, is it, which by that <hi>Father</hi> is still called <hi>late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brosissima quaestio,</hi> a <hi>most obscure que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,</hi> and such as he is not willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine in it.</p>

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:169777:126"/> pretended, that by <hi>water</hi> is meant that <hi>effect,</hi> i. e. that the <hi>cleansing</hi> and <hi>purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of the <hi>soul,</hi> which really is an <hi>effect</hi> of the <hi>spirit,</hi> is onely <hi>signified</hi> by the <hi>water;</hi> this is as far from proving the words to signifie the same, as our affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>water</hi> to be the <hi>Sign,</hi> and <hi>purifying the soul</hi> the <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>baptism,</hi> the <hi>rite</hi> of conveying that <hi>grace,</hi> can be deemed to conclude it our opinion, That <hi>water,</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>baptism,</hi> are all one.

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:169777:133"/> communicating</hi> of <hi>Infants,</hi> As it is certain that S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> interpreting that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of <hi>Christs, Joh.</hi> 6. literally of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> founded on it the <hi>necessity</hi> of <hi>exhibiting</hi> it to <hi>Infants</hi> newly <hi>baptized,</hi> and pressed the <hi>Pelagians</hi> with this, as <hi>Ecclesiae totius dogma, the opinion of the whole Church:</hi> So these two things are observable of it, First, the <hi>original,</hi> from whence this was first <hi>derived</hi> to <hi>Infants,</hi> viz. the <hi>custome</hi> (very <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>) of administring the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> to all <hi>adulti,</hi> or <hi>grown men</hi> and <hi>women,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently (the same <hi>day</hi> at least) after their <hi>baptism,</hi> from whence it came by degrees to <hi>Infants</hi> also. But then secondly, this was done with a considerable difference: Those of <hi>age</hi> received that <hi>Sacrament, sub utra{que} specie, under both kindes,</hi> both of <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>wine,</hi> but <hi>Infants</hi> onely under that of the <hi>wine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">l. <hi>1.</hi> de Sacr. c. <hi>20.</hi>
                  </note> if <hi>Hugo de Sancto Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctore</hi> may be credited <hi>(Pueris recens natis sacramentum in specie sanguinis est mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistratum)</hi> adding that reason for it, <hi>quia tales naturaliter sugere possunt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause such are naturally able to suck.</hi> Thirdly, that when this of <hi>communicating Infants</hi> was left off, yet the custome of giving the <hi>Sacrament</hi> to the <hi>Adulti</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon <hi>Baptism,</hi> lasted longer in the <hi>Church,</hi> and is mentioned by <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylact</hi> on the 10 of <hi>Luke:</hi> and so as this came in by <hi>mistake,</hi> it was <hi>deliberately,</hi>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:169777:133"/> and upon grounds of <hi>knowledge</hi> left off again. Fourthly, that even in the ages wherein this was used, and with some earnestness urged by S. <hi>Augustine</hi> against his <hi>adversaries,</hi> it is yet by him mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but as a <hi>dogma</hi> or <hi>opinion</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> (such are all the <hi>ceremonies</hi> of the <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches constituting</hi>) and neither as a <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> nor <hi>Tradition</hi> from the <hi>Apostles,</hi> as by the same S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and those which are <hi>ancienter</hi> then he, the <hi>baptizing</hi> of <hi>Infants</hi> is affirmed to be.</p>
               <p>Lastly then, I conceive, that the giving <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>80</label> of <hi>wine</hi> to the <hi>baptized Infants,</hi> differs much from admitting them to that <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and was at the most but an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of allowing them the <hi>Prayers</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> that they might be partakers of the <hi>death</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and all the <hi>benefits</hi> thereof, which still was but the kindeness and <hi>charity</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> toward them. But then it is evident, that beside this, there is much more in that <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and particularly the <hi>offering</hi> to <hi>God</hi> our <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable sacrifice,</hi> and <hi>plighting</hi> of our <hi>charity</hi> one to another, and of taking up <hi>Christs Cross,</hi> and so <hi>communicating</hi> with with his <hi>sufferings.</hi> And to this it is not pretended that <hi>Infants</hi> were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, either by themselves or their <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> (as in <hi>Baptism</hi> they are <hi>personally</hi> admitted to the <hi>benefits</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi>

And on the other side, througn the most <hi>flourishing</hi> ages of the <hi>ancient Church;</hi> we know that those that had been <hi>baptized</hi> in their <hi>infancy,</hi> but were not yet sufficiently <hi>instructed,</hi> were solemnly <hi>dismist</hi> out of the <hi>Church</hi> when the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> was to be <hi>celebrated,</hi> most strictly interdicted to be present to <hi>see,</hi> or <hi>approach</hi> those <hi>holy mysteries,</hi> As is known by the <hi>Ite missa est,</hi> the yonger sort were to depart, when the <hi>offertory-services</hi> began.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>83</label> It is known that <hi>Jeremies</hi> and <hi>Johns sanctification,</hi> or <hi>designation</hi> to <hi>holiness,</hi> was a work onely of <hi>Gods,</hi> and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not upon such accidental conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as is the <hi>cohabiting</hi> of the <hi>parents,</hi> and therefore cannot have place in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:169777:137"/> then as by <hi>Apostolical institution</hi>) such lower <hi>graces</hi> may be given as that lower state is capable of: Or however the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry receiving into <hi>Covenant,</hi> and being made capable of such superinvestitures, as this of <hi>Confirmation</hi> is, and with it of the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> of which without <hi>Baptism</hi> they are not in that Text supposed capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is a <hi>gift</hi> and <hi>benefit,</hi> and so a <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>baptism,</hi> very well worth the valuing.

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:169777:156"/> the parents, or the children? Not the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, for they are not capable of a Law; not the Parents; for then God hath put the salvation of innocent babes into the power of others.</hi> To this I answer, by renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the whole <hi>hypothesis</hi> affixt, by this way of arguing, to the maintainers of <hi>Paedobaptism.</hi> For we do not at all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it necessary to the <hi>salvation</hi> of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,</hi> upon the very ground that the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puter presumes it <hi>unnecessary,</hi> because it being acknowledged by all that it is not the <hi>omission,</hi> but <hi>contempt</hi> of <hi>Baptism,</hi> that damns, these two are not distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in <hi>children,</hi> who can no more be said to <hi>omit,</hi> then to <hi>contemn</hi> it. All the <hi>necessity</hi> we pretend to in this matter of <hi>Infants,</hi> is <hi>praecepti,</hi> not <hi>medii,</hi> not that it is a <hi>means,</hi> without which they cannot be saved, for then the argument would hold that they might be <hi>damned,</hi> or <hi>not saved</hi> by anothers default, without their own, but that, first, having <hi>foundation</hi> in the <hi>institution of Christ</hi> (as that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing founded in the <hi>Jews baptizing</hi> of <hi>Proselytes,</hi> belonged consequently to their <hi>yong children</hi> also) and secondly, <hi>authorized</hi> farther by the <hi>Apostles Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise,</hi> and thirdly, used through all ages of the <hi>Church</hi> accordingly; and fourthly, when the perversness of <hi>heretical</hi> men questioned and opposed it, defined by <hi>Councels;</hi> and fifthly, at length <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi>

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:169777:157"/> would say, that their baptism did produce spiritual effects,</hi> is presently at an end. All that we say of <hi>Baptism</hi> is, that it is a <hi>foederal</hi> ceremony of <hi>Christs Institution,</hi> to wash away <hi>Original guilt,</hi> and to admit us <hi>Proselytes</hi> unto himself, by his <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>conduit</hi> by which <hi>Christ</hi> is pleased to convey <hi>grace,</hi> and so gives us a solemn legal <hi>seizure</hi> of the <hi>advantages</hi> and benefits of the <hi>Covenant</hi> (all that at the <hi>present</hi> they are, or for the <hi>future</hi> shall be capable of) on condition they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form on their part (as soon as they are able to perform it) what on their part is <hi>promised</hi> in their <hi>names:</hi> wherein if they do not willingly fail, as, in case they dye in <hi>infancy,</hi> 'tis certain they do not, there is no question, but the <hi>mercies</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed in <hi>Baptism,</hi> may by <hi>Gods gracious</hi> supplies belong unto them. And it being as certain, that when, without any <hi>fault</hi> of theirs, they are <hi>unbaptized,</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect will never be charged upon them for evil, it must be resolved, that those ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that are <hi>consigned</hi> in <hi>Baptism,</hi> are not <hi>effects</hi> produced by it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently that the <hi>inconveniences</hi> or <hi>rocks</hi> imagined in that arguing, have been without that <hi>admonition</hi> very cautiously foreseen, and avoided by us.</p>

For to say that Infants may be damned for want of Baptism, is to affirm that of God, which we dare not say of any wise and good man.</hi> To this I answer, that I am absolutely resolved, that no <hi>childe</hi> shall be <hi>damned</hi> for want of <hi>Baptism,</hi> and that upon the very reason rendred, because <hi>it is not a thing in their power to acquire, they being persons not yet capable of a law,</hi> and consequently not <hi>capable</hi> of <hi>transgressing</hi> it. But this doth not yet conclude it the <hi>surer course,</hi> nor yet so <hi>sure,</hi> as the contrary, because that which <hi>hurts</hi> the <hi>Parents,</hi> or those, whose soever the duty is to bring the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to <hi>Baptism,</hi> cannot be said to be <hi>innocent.</hi> And indeed, the very suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, that the <hi>Infants incapacity</hi> of the <hi>command</hi> secures him from receiving hurt by the <hi>omission</hi> of <hi>Baptism,</hi> implies, that, if it were <hi>imputable</hi> to him, it would do him <hi>hurt,</hi> and therefore must be deemed to do so to those, that <hi>being capable</hi> (and now offered matter of conviction by this Paper, both from the <hi>institution</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Practise</hi> of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and the <hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,</hi> and (at length, when it was <hi>need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful)
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:169777:160"/> commands</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it to <hi>Infants</hi>) do still with <hi>contumacy</hi> reject, and vilifie it. And for propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionableness to <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>humane Reason,</hi> it is certainly most so, in <hi>providence</hi> to take the <hi>surest</hi> for all sides, That in case there be any <hi>necessity</hi> of it, more then we are <hi>aware</hi> of, in case any <hi>blessing</hi> of a <hi>present</hi> benefit, either from the <hi>Protection</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> or from <hi>preparing</hi> and <hi>predisposing</hi> grace to the childe, accompanying the <hi>Parents obedience,</hi> or the <hi>benediction</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> then by bringing the <hi>childe</hi> to <hi>Baptism,</hi> we make sure of it, but make no such <hi>provision</hi> by <hi>omitting</hi> it.</p>

                  <hi>Persecutor:</hi> Secondly, that he received it from <hi>Gamaliel</hi> the <hi>Iew,</hi> and not from <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Founder</hi> of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church:</hi> Thirdly, that he that would not own to have <hi>received</hi> any part of his <hi>Apostolical Power</hi> from S. <hi>Peter</hi> or any other <hi>man</hi> in the <hi>world, Gal.</hi> 1.1.<note place="margin">Gal. 1.1.</note> onely that he might owe it all to the <hi>Commission</hi> received from <hi>heaven,</hi> should now be constrained to acknowledge the receit of it from his old <hi>Master</hi> in the <hi>Iewish Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:</hi> Fourthly, that <hi>Barnabas</hi> which appears equally with <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>ordaining</hi> of <hi>Elders,</hi> Act. 14. should not in this <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation</hi> be taken notice of at all, nor <hi>consideration</hi> be had, whether what is said of <hi>Paul</hi> were in any degree appliable to <hi>him.</hi>

                     <hi>Volkelius</hi>'s arguments, proposed,</note> their great <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> hath said in this matter, l. 6. c. 12. <hi>de Miss. Eccl. Doct.</hi> where, under the name of the <hi>Pontificii,</hi> he sets himself against those, who <hi>being not content with the ancient custome of choosing Doctors and Pastors, do now require some singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Mission of them, and demand a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual uninterrupted, and that personal succession of Pastors.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Against Mission.</note> From hence there arise two branches of the discourse, 1. of the <hi>Mission,</hi> 2. of the <hi>Succession of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors.</hi> On the first head, he hath three things to say, First, that <hi>the place of Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> c. 23.21. <hi>I have not sent them, and yet they ran]</hi> can <hi>prove nothing against his pretensions, because there they that are found fault with, took upon them to be Prophets, and assumed a Mission, gloryed that they had a Province assigned them by God, of revealing some new things to his people, and consequently required credit to be yielded them, as Embassadors of Gods: But the modern Pastors of the Church, profess they are no Prophets, brag not of any such Embassie, undertake not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal any new thing, but onely inculcate that, which they finde in the writings of the Apostles, and acknowledge they may erre in understanding and explicating them, and require men to examine what they say, and beleive them no farther, then
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:169777:190"/> they shall be found to agree with Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second thing (which is but conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>82</label> to this) is, that <hi>those words, Rom.</hi> 10.15. <hi>How shall they preach except they be sent?] can yield as little ayd to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions, for that is spoken of those who were first to deliver the Christian faith, and so a new thing, to mankinde, and to confirm it so, as all were obliged to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce in their doctrine, which they could not have done, if they had not been sent as Embassadors on this errand: Whereas the modern Pastors make not themselves the first Preachers of the faith, assume no such authority to themselves, but contenting themselves with that Ordination of the Church, which the Apostles introduced, think they have done well, if they can but assist Christians in the knowledge and practise of Christian doctrine, which Ordination though it be laudable, and to be retained in the Church, whilst it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues prosperous, yet if in time of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Church be dissipated, and, on any occasion, that Ordination cannot be had, nothing hinders but that they which are able to instruct others to e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ernal life, may, without Ordination, propound the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian doctrine to men.</hi> And then his third thing is the proof of this last as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion from the <hi>example of those Act.</hi> 8.4. <hi>who being after the death of Stephen
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:169777:191"/> dispersed, were not ordained by any, and yet preached the doctrine of Christ, and the hand of the Lord was with them, saith S. Luke.</hi> And this is all he saith on the first Head.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>83</label> Of the second, <hi>concerning the succession of Pastors,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Against suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession. c. 13. <hi>De success. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storum.</hi>
                  </note> His first observation is, that <hi>the Apostles in creating Pastors looked not themselves after any succession, nor desired that it should be looked after in others, but thought it enough if they were so quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied as was required,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. <hi>where describing their office very largely, they yet give no precept, or syllable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning succession; which shews, that this is but a figment of those, that would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the authority of the Church, and more easily obtrude their doctrines upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But,</hi> saith he, <hi>this stratagem hath not succeeded, as they desired, with wise men, who do deny the necessity of that suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of Pastors, and onely assert the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal, not personal succession and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unless the assertors of that necessity</hi> (under the name of <hi>Pontificii</hi> again) <hi>can prove that their Bishops succeed the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles in purity of doctrine, they do nothing, though they never so oft inculcate the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of the persons. For the doctrinal succession is not so conjoyned with the personal, that one cannot subsist with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other, nothing hindring but that the doctrine may be changed, where the
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:169777:191"/> personal succession continues: Which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by their own confession, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Bishops of Apostolical Sees to have proved many of them haeretical. From whence</hi> he concludes, that <hi>the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal succession without the doctrinal, doth no more constitute a true Pastor, then the carnal succession from Abrahams loyns, makes the Jews the true people of God; and therefore they are not to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the successors of the Apostles, who are not begotten by them either after a carnal or a spiritual manner, though they can brag of sitting in their seats And as they that are not born of Abrahams seed, yet imitating his faith, are the true sons of Abraham, so they that follow the Apostles doctrine are true Doctors, though they do not personally succeed in their places.</hi>

                  </gap>, we are not now to be taught, having in the beginning of this discourse set it down at large, that though the <hi>original</hi> of it refer to the <hi>ceremony</hi> of <hi>holding up of hands,</hi> yet it signifies simply to <hi>ordain</hi> or <hi>constitute,</hi> without any respect to that <hi>ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony;</hi> and when it doth refer to it, it alwayes denotes their <hi>hands,</hi> and <hi>suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> of whom it is spoken, and cannot

And then, first, it would be as unreasonable to infer from the <hi>original</hi> of the word, that that <hi>cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> was there used, as <hi>Act.</hi> 1. to resolve that they used <hi>Counters</hi> in reckoning, or <hi>numbring Matthias</hi> with the <hi>eleven Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi> because the word <gap reason="foreign">

For it was distinctly <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> which did thus <gap reason="foreign">
